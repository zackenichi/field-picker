## What is this for?

This is a prototype for an email template feature

## What does this do?

You can add fields that can be added on the email template via a modern field selection modal.

### What else needs to be done? 

The next part would be to add a regex function that converts the selected fields into customer or company data.

Since this is just pure frontend, we will simulate database calls using a static file containing objects.

### Further things to be added

We can add a component that allows us to add more contacts or change company information.
